 
WARNING! PFRTP uses the GRI-Mech 3.0 kinetic mechanism to estimate the composition of flame off-gas given the input stoichiometric ratio. The subsequent evolution of that gas in the PFR system is based on the input kinetic mechanism. GRI-Mech 3.0 contains 18 species that were not identified in the input mechanism: CH2 NH NH2 NH3 NNH NO NO2 N2O HNO CN HCN H2CN HCNN HCNO HOCN HNCO NCO CH2CHO
You may wish to (a) check if any of the listed species are included in the input mechanism using a different name and rename them accordingly and/or (b) confirm that the listed species are not relevant in this case.
